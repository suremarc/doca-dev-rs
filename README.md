# doca-dev-rs

Development environment for NVIDIA DOCA SDK with Rust

## Dependencies

The only dependencies needed to setup this dev environment are VS Code, Docker, and QEMU if you're not on an ARM system.

## Build

To start up the dev environment in VS Code, press Ctrl+Shift+P, then select __Dev Containers: Reopen In Container.__ You now have a VS Code instance connected to a local Docker container with the DOCA SDK and Rust pre-installed.
